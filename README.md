## Tech Stack

- **Front-end:** The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. TypeScript is used to add static typing and improved tooling to the project.
- **Back-end:** The back-end of the application is developed using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It provides a solid foundation with built-in support for TypeScript and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.
- **Database:** The application utilizes a database management system like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data, posts, and other relevant information.
- **Authentication:** User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless authentication.
